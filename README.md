## Demo Applications

### Microservices & Distributed Systems

A collection of demo applications that showcase microservices architectures, distributed systems patterns, and modern cloud-native development practices.

**When to use**: If you are looking for an environment that is closest to a real production system, these demo environments are optimal for you.

- [bank of anthos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos) -  Retail banking sample application showcasing Kubernetes and Google Cloud.
- [microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) - Sample cloud-first application with 10 microservices showcasing Kubernetes, Istio, and gRPC.
- [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) - A microservice-based distributed system demonstrating OpenTelemetry implementation in a near real-world environment.
- [Podtato Head](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head) - A microservices demo application with multiple implementations and deployment options.
- [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) - A collection of full-stack applications demonstrating different frameworks and technologies.
- [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) - A sample Spring-based application that demonstrates best practices for building web applications.
- [The New Stack (TNS) observability app](https://github.com/grafana/tns) - A simple three-tier demo application, fully instrumented with the 3 pillars of observability: metrics, logs, and traces.


### Application Simulators

Applications that simulate real-world software behavior, traffic patterns, and user interactions without implementing any internal business logic. The applications are described with a DSL in
a configuration file.

**When to use**: If you need something that can be deployed on your machine and cluster, but is flexible in it's structure, these application simulators are for you.

- [App Simulator](https://github.com/cisco-open/app-simulator) - A tool for simulating application behavior and generating synthetic data.
- [ChaosMania](https://github.com/Causely/chaosmania) - A tool for simulating various application problems in microservices architectures running on Kubernetes.
- [Microcks](https://microcks.io/) - Open source (CNCF [project](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=microcks&item=app-definition-and-development--application-definition-image-build--microcks)), cloud native API mocking and testing platform supporting OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, gRPC/Protobuf, GraphQL, and SOAP; provides smart dynamic mocking and contract testing with CI/CD integration.

## Synthetic Data Generators

Tools and libraries for generating synthetic application data that mimics real-world patterns and behaviors.

**When to use**: If you only care about the data that is generated and send to your analytics or observability platform, these synthetic data generators are for you.

- [AI-Powered Observability Demo Generator](https://github.com/davidgeorgehope/otel-demo-gen) - Users can describe scenarios in natural language, and the system will generate and stream synthetic telemetry into OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collectors via OTLP.
- [fuzzy-train](https://github.com/sagarnikam123/fuzzy-train) - A versatile fake log generator for testing and development that runs anywhere, supporting multiple formats (JSON, logfmt, Apache, syslog) with configurable output options.
- [Mustermann](https://github.com/schultyy/mustermann) - A tool that generates test data for OpenTelemetry pipelines using a custom virtual machine.
- [otelgen](https://github.com/krzko/otelgen) - A tool to generate synthetic OpenTelemetry logs, metrics and traces using OTLP (gRPC and HTTP).
- [Telemetry generator for OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/cmd/telemetrygen) - This utility simulates a client generating traces, metrics, and logs. It is useful for testing and demonstration purposes.
- [Test Telemetry Generator](https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator) - A tool for generating synthetic telemetry data for testing and demonstration.
- [Trace Simulation Receiver](https://github.com/k4ji/tracesimulationreceiver) - A tool for simulating and generating trace data in various formats.
