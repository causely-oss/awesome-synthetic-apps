## Demo Applications

### Microservices & Distributed Systems

A collection of demo applications that showcase microservices architectures, distributed systems patterns, and modern cloud-native development practices.

- [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) - A microservice-based distributed system demonstrating OpenTelemetry implementation in a near real-world environment.
- [Podtato Head](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head) - A microservices demo application with multiple implementations and deployment options.
- [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) - A sample Spring-based application that demonstrates best practices for building web applications.
- [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) - A collection of full-stack applications demonstrating different frameworks and technologies.

### Application Simulators

Applications that simulate real-world software behavior, traffic patterns, and user interactions without implementing any internal business logic. The applications are described with a DSL in
a configuration file.

- [App Simulator](https://github.com/cisco-open/app-simulator) - A tool for simulating application behavior and generating synthetic data.
- [ChaosMania](https://github.com/Causely/chaosmania) - A tool for simulating various application problems in microservices architectures running on Kubernetes.

## Synthetic Data Generators

Tools and libraries for generating synthetic application data that mimics real-world patterns and behaviors.

- [Test Telemetry Generator](https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator) - A tool for generating synthetic telemetry data for testing and demonstration.
- [Trace Simulation Receiver](https://github.com/k4ji/tracesimulationreceiver) - A tool for simulating and generating trace data in various formats.
- [Mustermann](https://github.com/schultyy/mustermann) - A tool that generates test data for OpenTelemetry pipelines using a custom virtual machine.

## Sample Data Sets

_Coming soon - This section will include links to sample data sets that can be used for testing and demonstration purposes._
